  <h2>About Me</h2>

  

    <p id="p1">My name is Derrick Reyes. I am a Texas native who has been here in the Phoenix area since 2001. I graduated from Central High School in 2004. Shortly after graduating from high school I joined the United States Navy, where I spent the next five years of my life. I was honorably discharged from the United States Navy in 2009 at which point I moved back to Phoenix to discover the next chapter in my life. I decided to continue my education at Arizona State University in the field of Business Communications. After two years at ASU, I transfered to the University of Phoenix for the remainder of my bachelor degree program. In 2013, I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Business Management. 

    <p> I am excited for the newest venture in my personal and professional which is to learn and complete the University of Arizona Coding Academy. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and growing in this field.
